# Ganesha Sudoku

Welcome to **Ganesha Sudoku**, a themed version of the classic Sudoku puzzle game — inspired by the symbolism of Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and patron of wisdom. May this game bring you focus, clarity, and enjoyment.

## 🎮 About the Game

Ganesha Sudoku is a modern, elegant implementation of the traditional Sudoku game. It provides a smooth and intuitive experience thanks to a clean design and simple interactions.

This project was developed using **Vite.js (React.js)** for fast performance and modern frontend structure, along with **Chakra UI** for accessible, beautiful UI components.

## 🧩 How to Play Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid so that:

* Each **row** contains all digits from **1 to 9** (no duplicates).
* Each **column** contains all digits from **1 to 9**.
* Each **3×3 sub-grid** (called a "box" or "region") also contains the digits **1 to 9**.

No guessing is required — only logic!

## 🌟 Ganesha Theme

The game features a Ganesha-inspired aesthetic, symbolizing:

* **Wisdom** to solve logical challenges
* **Patience** to complete the grid step by step
* **Good fortune** throughout your puzzle journey

May Lord Ganesha guide you through each challenge as you clear obstacles and complete the puzzle.
